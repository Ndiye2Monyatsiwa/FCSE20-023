         <h1 style="font-style: bold;">THE HISTORY OF LONDON</h1>
		 
		 <article>
         <section>
            <p style="font-style: bold;">London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom, as well as one of the world's largest and most influential cities. Early hunter-gatherers first populated the area approximately 6,000 B.C., and scholars have discovered Bronze Age bridges and Iron Age forts along the River Thames. In 43 A.D., the ancient Romans founded Londinium, a port and commercial colony, and a bridge across the Thames was built a few years later to aid business and military movements. However, in 60 A.D., Celtic queen Boudicca led an army to sack the city, which was subsequently burned to the ground in the first of many fires that would eventually destroy London.

The city was quickly restored, but it burned down again in the year 125 A.D. More rebuilding was place, and the population grew to about 40,000 people within a few generations. However, following the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D., the city was repeatedly assaulted by Vikings and other attackers, and London was mostly abandoned.</p>

<p>When Westminster Abbey was built in 1065, the city's fortunes began to alter. William the Conqueror was anointed King of England a year later, following his victory at the Battle of Hastings. The Tower of London was built during his reign, and a wooden London Bridge that had repeatedly burned was replaced by a stone bridge in 1176.

London rose in size and importance as the Tudor and Stuart dynasties increased in power (the bloodline from which the current queen is descended). By the time Henry VIII became king, London had a population of at least 100,000 people.</p>

<p>The Great Plague, which killed over 100,000 people in London in 1665, was a true calamity. The metropolis, which had swelled to almost a half-million people and was primarily housed in wooden constructions, was reduced to ashes once more in the Great Fire of London a year later. Many famous buildings were built in the aftermath of the fire, including Buckingham Palace and St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Bank of England was established in 1694 and was led by Huguenot John Houblon, who helped transform London into a global financial powerhouse. By 1840, the city had swelled to 2 million residents, many of whom were crammed into filthy hovels, contributing to cholera and other illness epidemics.</p>

<p>London was well established as the prestigious seat of the vast British Empire during Queen Victoria's reign, and while Big Ben rose above the city in 1859, the London Underground, the world's first subterranean railway, opened in 1863. In 1888, however, Jack the Ripper stalked the city's women in the shadows of the great metropolis, killing at least five in one of history's most notorious murder sprees.</p>
