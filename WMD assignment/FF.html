	<article>
	<section>
	<p>London is one of the world's fashion capitals. London is home to some of the world's most recognizable department shops and fashion labels, providing a wealth of options for the stylish and fashionable. We've got some insider tips in our fashion lover's guide to London, whether you appreciate the seductive rush of central London shopping or are searching for something a little more off the beaten path.</p>
	
	<p>The Thomas Café is a great place to start your day in the capital if you want to be stylish. The Thomas Café, located at 121 Regent Street in Burberry's flagship shop, is the fashion house's first foray into the restaurant business. The all-day eatery, named after the brand's founder Thomas Burberry, boasts a fantastic British-inspired menu. You may relish their AGA cooked scones and crumpets while browsing the café's specialized giving area, which features a wealth of seasonally updated Burberry treats (that can all be personalised and monogrammed).</p>

	<p>After your elegant brunch, drive north up Regent Street to see Chanel, Michael Kors, Longchamp, and Vivienne Westwood, among the capital's most iconic flagship boutiques. You can even pop inside London's famed Liberty before the tourist buying frenzy reaches its climax. Liberty boasts approximately 150 years of competence in fashion and cosmetics, stocking archetypal designers as well as an exclusive collection of emerging designers, and is housed in a stunning Tudor renaissance structure.</p>

	<p>Those interested in modern fashion should head to Mayfair, where Rei Kawakubo's Dover Street Market reigns supreme as the go-to destination for the fashion elite. Dover Street Market, on Haymarket, is a concept store designed by Rei Kawakubo that offers Comme de Garcons, an archival Japanese label, as well as a variety of complementary and emerging labels. The market's lower levels include a chosen range of more cheap items, while the middle and upper floors have statement and designer pieces from Gucci, Loewe, and Molly Goddard, among others.</p>

	<p>Dover Street Market is also known for its sample deals, which offer up to 80% off its brands — keep an eye on their Instagram and other media pages for updates on upcoming bargains. If Dover Street Market piques your curiosity, the ultra-chic LN-CC on Shacklewell Lane in Dalston is well worth a visit. LN-CC is a futuristic concept store with a diverse variety of contemporary designs, specializing in niche concepts.</p>

	<p>Fashionistas looking for a bargain may visit Pimlico's famous Capital Carboot. Every Sunday, this is a great place to go rummaging for a designer steal or a vintage find. General admission is £1 beginning at 11.30 a.m., but it is recommended that you pay the $5 early-bird fee to enter at 10.15 a.m. for the best rummage area! Spitalfields Market, which has a vast choice of apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and ethical goods from 88 independent designers and sellers, is also worth a visit for those looking for vintage or unique treasures.</p>

	<p>A visit to the V&A in South Kensington is a must for any fashionista visiting the capital. The V&A houses pivotal designs by prominent fashion businesses such as Coco Chanel, Dior, Cristóbal Balenciaga, Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano, Elsa Schiaparelli, and many others, and boasts a world-class collection of historical fashion. The V&A also houses one of the world's most comprehensive jewelry collections — forget Tiffany and visit The William and Judith Bollinger Jewellery Gallery, which houses 3,500 pieces. Two Cartier diamond tiaras, a rare plique-à-jour enamel and pearl bracelet, and a rare plique-à-jour enamel and pearl bracelet by Boucheron are among the jewels on display at the exhibition.</p>

	<p>Finish off your day at Sketch, one of London’s most fashionable restaurants. Located at 9 Conduit St, Mayfair, Sketch is located in a former Christian Dior boutique and currently holds two Michelin stars.  Including a variety of dining rooms and menus, Sketch is famous for its sumptuously pink dining room, decorated by artist David Shrigley</p>
