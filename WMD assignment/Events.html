	   <p>Bonfire Night is an annual festival that takes place in many parts of the world and is based on numerous traditions and customs.</p>
	   <p>Bonfire Night is celebrated in the United Kingdom on November 5th, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' attempt to blow up the House of Parliament in order to assassinate King James I.</p>
	   <p>As a result, London's Bonfire Night commemorates this soldier's failure.</p>
	   <p>The original one-night festival usually lasts an entire weekend, with people drawn in by the traditional bonfire toffee, sweet apple, black peas, or Catherine Wheel biscuits, which can be enjoyed while viewing the amazing fireworks display.</p>
